## Overview

#### Database Upgrade
In Qtodo v3.0, the most significant improvement is the database transition. By switching from User Defaults to Core Data, users are now offered the ability to store much larger data.

 - Users can enter description text for each task.
 - Users can categorize their tasks (Personal, Work, Shopping, Home, Education, Health, and Other).
 - Users can assign a due date to their tasks.
 - Users can prioritize their tasks on a scale of 1 to 100.
 
#### Advanced Task Listing Options
For listing recorded tasks, there are now more options available:

 - Listing tasks by category.
 - Listing active, completed, or all tasks.
 - Sorting tasks by creation date, priority level, or due date.
